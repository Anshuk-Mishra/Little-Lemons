# Little-Lemons

Little Lemons is a web application that was built using the Django web framework. Django is a powerful and flexible web framework that is widely used for building complex, data-driven websites. Using Django for the Little Lemons website allowed for efficient development and maintenance of the application, while ensuring that it is secure and scalable.

The Little Lemons website also incorporates a SQLite database, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use relational database management system. The database stores the website's data, such as user profiles, product listings, and order histories. With the help of Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, developers can easily interact with the database and retrieve data from it to be displayed on the website.

In addition, the Little Lemons website uses views to handle user requests and generate responses. Views are Python functions that define the logic of the web application, and they interact with the database to retrieve and manipulate data. The views then render the data into HTML templates that are sent to the user's web browser.

To create the website's user interface, the Little Lemons website also uses templates and template inheritance. Templates define the structure and layout of the HTML pages that the user sees, and they use Django's template language to dynamically display data from the views and database. Template inheritance allows for the reuse of common code across multiple pages, which simplifies development and maintenance.

Overall, the Little Lemons website is a great example of the power and flexibility of the Django web framework, and how it can be used to build robust and scalable web applications. With its use of SQLite, views, templates, and template inheritance, the website provides a great user experience while also being easy to maintain and update.
